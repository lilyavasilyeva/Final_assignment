# Final_assignment
The repository contains one postman collection in json format, one python script with tests and a checklist.
Python script was written as an experiment and is in development.
To learn more about the API under testing go to https://www.wordsapi.com/docs/?python#introduction.

!File Word_API.postman_collection_edit.json contains an edited response json body check function.

!To run whole postman collection without freezing please skip the folowing tests: 'wrong host in header', 'wrong request from docs', 'wrong request and header from docs'.
